      We introduce Label Anything, a transformer-based framework for multi-prompt, multi-way few-shot semantic segmentation. Our model unifies diverse visual prompts—points, boxes, and masks—into a single, flexible architecture that generalizes across tasks while reducing annotation effort. Evaluated on the COCO-20i benchmark, it achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong multi-class segmentation capabilities.

      We present RoWeeder, an unsupervised framework for weed mapping that integrates crop-row detection with a noise-resilient deep learning model. By generating pseudo-ground truth from crop-row geometry, our lightweight network learns to distinguish crops from weeds under noisy conditions. Evaluated on the WeedMap dataset, RoWeeder surpasses existing baselines and enables real-time, drone-based weed monitoring for precision agriculture.

      We introduce a lightweight Vision Transformer for drone-based multispectral weed mapping in precision agriculture. The model transfers knowledge from RGB pretraining to multispectral data, achieving state-of-the-art results on the WeedMap dataset and enabling efficient, non-invasive weed detection for targeted herbicide management.

      Our approach employs state-of-the-art knowledge distillation to transfer performance from a large teacher network to a compact student model, achieving high accuracy on the WeedMap dataset with a fraction of the computation. The method enables efficient, drone-deployable weed detection for sustainable precision agriculture.
