## About me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Computational Intelligence Lab (CILAB)](http://cilab.di.uniba.it), University of Bari Aldo Moro. 

My research focuses on data-efficient and explainable deep learning for computer vision, with applications in large-scale and real-world visual understanding. 

I am currently working on few-shot semantic segmentation and edge AI methods developed in collaboration with the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (Netherlands).

## Research interests

- **Computer Vision:** Semantic segmentation, Scene understanding, Object detection  
- **Machine Learning:** Few-shot learning, Transfer learning, Explainable AI  
- **Applied AI:** Edge intelligence, Efficient deep architectures, Sustainable computing
